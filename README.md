Calculator with "windows form app" in C#

Hi, I designed an easy to use calculator. 

You can access this simple tool by clicking the calculator_ex.exe application inside the Calculator.rar file.

You can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentile, negative/positive, decimal number calculations.
